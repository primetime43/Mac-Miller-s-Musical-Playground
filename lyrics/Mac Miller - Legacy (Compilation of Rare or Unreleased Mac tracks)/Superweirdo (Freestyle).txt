[Intro]
(Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew)
Live from the battlefield
(Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew)
Comes Superweirdo
(Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh)

[Verse]
Okay, my name Mac Miller who the fuck are you?
(Who the fuck are you?)
Paranoid motherfuck around where I don’t even trust the truth
This ain’t the motherfuckin’ Huxstables, so if my mother doing nothing I’ma cut her loose (Get her outta here)
I waste no time, criminal since ‘09
Posted on the coast line, smokin’ on that- (Oh my)
Everybody say I do it, so.. (Well, well, well, well)
Young anomaly, destroying your Metropolis
Stay inside, I turn Rodeo Drive into the Gaza Strip (Woah)
It’s the raw shit, drunk off confidence
I don’t got a dealer, got an anesthesiologist (Wow, bitch)
My shit is Artemis Fowl, (Okay)
I’m standing on the edge they try calmin’ me down
(come on man, come on man, come on man, come on man)
They talk fast but they listen slow (Listen slow)
There ain’t a better coach around than Dick LeBeau (Woah, woah)

[Outro]
Oh my...
