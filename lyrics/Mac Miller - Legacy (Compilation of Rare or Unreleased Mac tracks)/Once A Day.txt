Once a day I Rise
Once a day I fall asleep with you
Once a day I try, but I can't find a single word

I wonder what they know
I wonder if they ever even cared at all
I wonder do they see their own reflection in the rain and look away

Everybody keep rushin'
Why aren't we taking our time?
Every now and again baby I get high

Don't ask me what I think
It never really mattered what I had to say
I just keep waiting for another open door to come by soon
Don't keep it all in your head
The only place that you know nobody ever can see
You runnin' low on regret
No tears that's keeping you wet
I think you gettin' it now

But everybody keep rushing
Why aren't we taking our time?
Every now and again baby I get high

And everybody means something
When they stuck on your mind
But every now and again why can't we just be fine

Once a day I rise
Once a day I fall asleep with you
Once a day I try, but I can't find a single word
