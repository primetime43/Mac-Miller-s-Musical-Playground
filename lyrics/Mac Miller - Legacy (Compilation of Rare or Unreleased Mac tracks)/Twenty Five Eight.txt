Yeah, yeah
Okay
(These muthafuckas)

[Chorus]
Any day in the week
Every month, all year round
(These muthafuckas crazy)
No danger to me, the game made me a beast
And I gotta eat
(These muthafuckas)
Think this shit come easy
No handouts no muthafuckin' freebies
(These muthafuckas lazy)
I'ma be awake at my wake
Fuck twenty four seven shit is twenty five eight

[Hook]
And I'm sleep
Twenty five eight
All day everyday
Twenty five eight
Gotta eat
Twenty five eight
Too much money to be made
Twenty five eight
This shit ain't free
Twenty five eight
(yeah)
Can't afford to wait no more
Twenty five eight
Tell God goodmornin' when I wake up
(But one day I'm gon' rule the world)

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Never taken shit for granted
Spend alotta days in this game 'for I ran it
When the money gone hoes vanish
Dorthy, we ain't in Kansas no more
Yeah
Bitches won't stop calling my line
But I'm too busy turnin' water to wine
Outta my mind
These type of things happen all the time
You gotta get yours
But me I gotta get mine
Homie I made it from the basement to
Gettin' faded on stage with Snoop
It's the capital M A C M I
Double L don't forget the E R
It's plenty room for you and your crew
M O S T D O P E that's who we are
The flow cold get a bubble goose
Gotta old soul with the money new
There's a difference between hobbies and carriers
For Heaven sake I had it up to here with these muthafuckas
(These muthafuckas)

[Chorus]
Any day in the week
Every month, all year round
(These muthafuckas crazy)
No danger to me, the game made me a beast
And I gotta eat
(These muthafuckas)
Think this shit come easy
No handouts no muthafuckin' freebies
(These muthafuckas lazy)
I'ma be awake at my wake(Count your blessings)
Fuck twenty four seven shit is twenty five eight

[Hook]
And I'm sleep
Twenty five eight
All day everyday
Twenty five eight
Gotta eat
Twenty five eight
Too much money to be made
Twenty five eight
This shit ain't free
Twenty five eight
(yeah)
Can't afford to wait no more
Twenty five eight
Tell God goodmornin' when I wake up
(But one day I'm gon' rule the world)

[Verse 2]
If you lookin' for a king then you found one
Popped out of my mother placenta with a crown on
Gotta new bitch keep the frown on
She tell me "I need to grow up"
I tell her she need to get on my level and show respect to the motherfucker just cuttin' the check
She ain't gunna be around long and that's fine
For now we naked on the couch watchin' movie with the sound on
It's time
But never mind that's another story
For a better time when it's better for me
Cold dough burger shit is forty
Might fuck around pour a four in a forty
Now it's four in the morning
She out cold sleepin' on the couch with her mouth wide me I'm still going
Fuck everybody but us
This why I can't trust

[Chorus]
Any day in the week
Every month, all year round
(These muthafuckas crazy)
No danger to me, the game made me a beast
And I gotta eat
(These muthafuckas)
Think this shit come easy
No handouts no muthafuckin' freebies
(These muthafuckas lazy)
I'ma be awake at my wake(Count your blessings)
Fuck twenty four seven shit is twenty five eight

[Hook]
And I'm sleep
Twenty five eight
All day everyday
Twenty five eight
Gotta eat
Twenty five eight
Too much money to be made
Twenty five eight
This shit ain't free
Twenty five eight
(yeah)
Can't afford to wait no more
Twenty five eight
Tell God goodmornin' when I wake up
(But one day I'm gon' rule the world)
Twenty five eight
