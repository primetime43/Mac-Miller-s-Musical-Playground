[Verse 1]
You smell just like [?]
Little bit of nose spells you're a blind bat [?]
When I first learned to love you
She passin' me by she burrin' rubber
These slide shows in my mind while
She playing cool but her eyes don't lie though(Better drive slow)
If you wanna take a ride on the high road(Woah)
And your mind so passionate
You love what I'm [?] in
That feelin' so unfamiliar I only imagine it
(Dream girl, you're my make believe girl)

[Hook]
I'ma bet it all on you
I'ma cheer you up
Why you bein' so blue, yeah
I'ma put you in the mood
Baby girl them butterflies stick like glue
Butterflies, butterflies(Butterflies stick like glue)
Butterflies(Butterflies stick like glue)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, okay
Beauty queen beauty queen
Straight outta of movie scene
Touchin' on yo body
I could feel you in a lucid dream
This my imagination ooh
You keep me fascinated
You, are, a forbidden fruit
I be apple tastin'
She is glowin' baby
I think I need a moment
I keep you open, late
Do you even know my, name
(Why am I a stranger)
Yeah
She dancin' on the street
It's her favorite ol' song
And she playin' out the stereo, the radio on
Do she love me like I love her
Use me what she need a lover
Yeah
She got me under her spell
Goin' round ring a bell

[Hook]
I'ma bet it all on you
I'ma cheer you up
Why you bein' so blue, yeah
I'ma put you in the mood
Baby girl them butterflies stick like glue
Butterflies, butterflies(Butterflies stick like glue)
Butterflies, butterflies(Butterflies stick like glue)
There's no emotion powerful as love
There's no emotion powerful as love
There's no emotion powerful as love
As love, as love
