[Intro]
Yeah (Woo)
Yeah (Woo)
Yeah (Woo)
Excited

[Verse 1: Seth Hirsch]
Too many days that I've been in the field
I've been making plays just like the NFL
Couple Xanax and a couple Benadryl
She prepared to blackout like electric bills
Saint Laurent rockin', shorty swagged out
Love it when I pull the bag out
Double demon, wanna be fertile season
Get a Sephora, freak out when she lash out
Strangled my heart, left me on read
Becky the killer, she left me for dead (Uh, yeah)
Say that I'm trippin', it's all in my head (Uh, yeah)
Getting too snippy, I'm by a thread
Nobody knows trouble I seen
Body with some brown eyes and tight jeans
Shorty archin' up her back in photos
Sayin' she my ray that's a low blow

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Do you get hi-i-igh? (We so)
One at a ti-i-ime (We so)
Yeah, you were mi-i-ine
Say goodbye-eye-eye
Girl don't cry-eye-eye
It's al-

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Goddamn it, baby; why you so shady?
You lie, oh, you lie
I know I might be crazy, but you might be wastin' my time
And Lord knows I've tried
So keep it real
Livin' with a heart that's broken
We know how that feel we always caught up in the moment
And this ain't no drill, one shot one kill
Just pop one pill, you'll be good by the morning

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Do you get hi-i-igh? (We so)
One at a ti-i-ime (We so)
Yeah, you were mi-i-ine
Say goodbye-eye-eye
Girl don't cry-eye-eye
It's alright
Do you get hi-i-igh?

[Outro: Mac Miller]
You were mi-i-ine
Say goodbye-eye-eye
Do you get hi-i-igh?
