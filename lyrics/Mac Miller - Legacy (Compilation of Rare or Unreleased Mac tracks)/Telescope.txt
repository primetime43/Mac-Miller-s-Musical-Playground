[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Things like this ain't built to last
I might just fade like those before me
When will you forget my past
Got questions, ask, you know the stories
And you need to let me know
When you leave and where you go
Can I come
Do you believe me, are you close
Yeah, even if you don't, that'll get you sprung

[Chorus]
Do I Do I Do I
Look
Can I Can I Can I
Get a look

[Verse 2]
Yeah, don't run away love, hate love
Heart break or have you bankrupt
Too many days in a daze, better wake up
I'll put your face in the place where the space was
Nobody make you feel like you but (Do I)
And you don't know what you should do
You just looking for someone to make you move
Ooh, tell me (Do I)

[Hook]
I'll make this planet feel like home
It's us, first time the door is closing
So far beyond all our control
You say this song
So close to broken

[Verse 3]
Yeah, it's so much better when you wait
Forever and a day, it's all I got
Yeah, put it together then it break
All the energy it take
And now it's dark

[Chorus]
Do I Do I Do I
Look
Can I Can I Can I
Get a look

[Verse 4]
Yeah, I never slip, I never fall
I try to tell you 'bout a better life, you get involved
Big or small, it's been my fault
I keep you safe, it's in the vault
Blind folded keep it going till we hit a wall
Yeah, I'm never going through the motions
I'm just tryna lay your body down slowly
We can only go up, we can only go up

[Hook]
I'll make this planet feel like home
It's us, first time the door is closing
So far beyond all our control
You say this song
So close to broken

[Chorus]
Do I Do I Do I
Look
Can I Can I Can I
Get a look
