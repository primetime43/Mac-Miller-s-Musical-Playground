[Intro: Young Thug]
Yeah
Ayy
Listen

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
S-N-Double-O-P, I'm a dizz-og
Shit, he was talking brazy, I ain't lie, I knocked the nigga off
I ain't tryna give him a chance to kill me or take the stand on me
He know I just had 100,000 piece saran'd on me
I had to hand my [?]
I tried to take back all the watches, rings and the necklaces
She said I'm taking full advantage 'cause I'm never stressing
'Cause I had feelings for this girl that daddy homed as restless
Don't get me wrong 'cause it ain't nothing 'bout that money, nigga
I meant to tell you, since a kid, I been getting my own figures
I was bringing in the racks and she was steady shopping
I'm talking big bills, all colors, nigga, Monolopy
I ain't trippin', bitch, I'm sharper than a damn machete
Super different, I even stood out on my own partners
Since a kid I been a dresser, Thousand Island
I was shitting my diamonds, green, piss a port-a-potty, woah, yeah

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Bitch talk to me while I'm sleeping, yeah, yeah
Swimming in the linen like deep-end, yeah, yeah
All I never needed was a alibi, yeah, yeah
I don't need a motherfucking reason, yeah
Out of mind, so I keep a pizzy
Everything 100, I don't ever leave a 50, yeah
Did my own half-time, if I was simple
What the fuck you think I'm rich for?
Why you think I'm always talking shit, with my hand on my dick?
In the crib, this bitch turn into a strip show
It's what it is, though
Yeah, yeah, it's what it is, though
Yeah, whoa, leave me alone, take your ass home
If it ain't another million, I ain't picking up the phone
Phony motherfuckers always sittin' on the throne
All I want's some pussy, baby, give a dog a bone, yeah, yeah
I don't need a lot but I got a lot
I don't need a lot but I got a lot
Yeah, 200 for the whip in the parking lot
Everything cuttin', turn this shit into a barber shop
Swear I'm always shining, couldn't tell you if it's dark or not
Just a couple things I thought about, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Trippie Redd]
How the fuck you ever try to play me?
I thought you was my love, man, I even called you baby
You played me, went from my mud to Slim Shady
Now demonic thoughts in my head, this shit crazy
Thanking God for everything I got, told him to save me
Do whatever for my OGs, nigga, that's who raised me
You made me blind to reality, that shit fugazi
Yeah, I said that shit is so fugazi
Now I'm swervin' round in this Mercedes
Yeah, you can love me or you hate me
He just mad 'cause that pussy nigga ain't me
I'm gettin' money, I ain't gon' let that shit faze me

[Outro: Trippie Redd]
I'm good, bro, what's up?
No cap
