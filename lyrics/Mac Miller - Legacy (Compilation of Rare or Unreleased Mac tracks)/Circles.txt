[Verse]
Well, this is what it look like, right before you fall
Stumblin' around, you been guessing your direction, except you can't see at all
And I don't have a name, I don't have a name, no
Who am I to blame? Who am I to blame? No
And I cannot be changed, I cannot be changed, no, trust me, I've tried
I just end up right at the start of the line, drawin' circles, mhm
I drank my whiskey, you sip your wine
We're doing well, sittin' watchin' the world fallin' down it's decline
I can keep you safe, I can keep you safe
Do not be afraid, do not be afraid
You're feeling sorry, I'm feeling fine
Don't you put any more stress on yourself, it's one day at a time
It's gettin' pretty late, gettin' pretty late and that's fine
It goes around like the hands that keep countin' the time, drawin' circles
