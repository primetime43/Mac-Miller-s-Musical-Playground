[Chorus]
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, it's all my fault
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, I know

[Verse 1]
Time movin' slowly
I'm bouncin' my head off the wall
I know nobody that knows where we're going at all
Don't, don't, don't, don't let me down
And I'll pick you up
How did you get on the ground?

[Chorus]
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, it's all my fault
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, I know

[Bridge]
I'll play these cords
I'll play the strings
Pull back, I'm flyin'

[Verse 2]
And I don't know where I been lately but I been up late
I said good mornin' this mornin' and I'll say goodnight
Don't, don't, don't, don't wait around
We'll take the steps that been fussin' the devil
So [?]

[Chorus]
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, it's all my fault
That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, I know
