Wake up, wake up
Wake up
Ring, ring, ring!


Welcome to reality
See, there's this or your fatality
I am gravity, I am your majesty
I'm the truth and that's a reason that you mad at me
I'm the source of all your power, I'm your battery
I can either be the end or be your masterpiece
I can either be a friend or be a casualty
I am your addiction, you are attached to me
You try to run away, but always coming back to me
Good and evil, I am duality
I'm the creator, I am God inside this factory
I'm blasphemy, I'm standing on the edge
And there ain't a place I'd rather be
Yeah, you have a dream
You have a dream
But if you're not ready to wake up, then go back to sleep
Open up your eyes
Yeah, you have to see
Fuck rulling the world, I want the galaxy


It's time to wake up (Wake up, wake up, wake up)
Good morning!
Good morning, motherfucker!
