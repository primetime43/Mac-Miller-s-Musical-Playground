[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, um okay
Uh, I'm stepping out the flux capacitor
Go to Africa to come back wearin’ jackal fur (woah)
This ain't a rap song, it's a massacre, only sacrificing those
Who know to say the magic words
Stop, somebody get that man a pacifier, y’all ain't shit but the appetizer (no)
I'm at a diner with a bad vagina sippin' on some red wine, when I die, told her snort my ashes, that's a dead line
I'm doin' just fine, controlling suicidal thoughts, and when I'm
Runnin’ out of time then imma buy the clock
(lemme get that boy)
Life’s meaning tends to tie the open-minded knots, if it's all a game I’m at the final boss
You won't stop us with a diamond cross, this type of demon
Crucifies the fake who try to floss, and if the rain is just the crying gods, then Utopia's behind the fog

[Verse 2: Delusional Thomas]
See, my eyes wide shut, I'm laying down in a field of roses
When sanity is at a distance then we feel the closest
Society is all a joke
Turn the television on and see tomorrow’s hoax

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
You'll fit the picture with a doctored pose, just be like everybody else and never walk alone
I'm on the phone with the devil speaking monotone, getting bored with all these threats that he throwin' at me
Why are we so unhappy?
Yeah

[Bridge: Delusional Thomas & Mac Miller]
Why are we so unhappy? (Yeah)
Why are we so unhappy? (Yeah)
Why are we so unhappy? (Yeah)


[Verse 4: Mac Miller]
Okay, okay
So can you, tell the captain that his boat about to sink and Mr. Drummond's wife is somewhere smoking meth on the ship deck
We living in a shipwreck, nothin' but some insects, obsessed with sex and this business giving big checks
Been ready to die until I realized I haven't lived yet, I haven't made an indent to the Lord to try to impress (praise God)
I just wish that I was fearless, biking down the mountain start to tremble as the gears switch
So hear this hear this, come bathe in my appearance, when life give you a car learn to steer before you crash
There's more than cash and there's more than ass, 'cause all those pleasures turn to torture fast (fast), and you can try to fight it but you never win (no), they assemble into evidence to keep you from the truth and the lies (lies)
We fall into the glamour like a cancer, the answer is there ain't an answer, bitch

[Outro]
Why are we so unhappy? Yeah
Why are we so unhappy? Yeah
Why are we so unhappy? Yeah
Why are we so unhappy? Yeah
