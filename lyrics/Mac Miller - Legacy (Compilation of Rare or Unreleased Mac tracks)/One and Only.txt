[Intro]
Hey yeah, hey yeah

[Hook]
Well, I just need a little space, I can be my own me
Yeah, I'm just giving you a taste
It's some one and only, this that one and only
Yeah, I got what you need, what you need, what you need
Shit, you know how it be, how it be, how it be yeah
All I ever needed was some one and only, this that one and only

[Verse 1]
Well, hello good evening
I'm with you long as I'm breathing
For every season my girl she keep on keeping me decent
I'm working not taking weekends
I barely got time for sleeping
Searching for meaning, fiending for freakiness
How it's being shit
I been the coldest, since winter solstice
I had a soul I know that shit is frozen
Out of control I am a living moment
I got that dopamine know if you want it yeah
Feel like I'm running out of time a couple days behind
This shit that's running through my mind
There ain't no way I'm fine
And maybe I'm just wasting time
Sick of playing games get out my gymnasium
I am a collector, of money and pressure
There's nobody better, out of my skull I'm Hannibal Lecter
Yessir, killing all the noise
You know how it go; first you build it then destroy

[Hook]
Well, I just need a little space, I can be my own me
Yeah, I'm just giving you a taste
It's some one and only, this that one and only
Yeah, I got what you need, what you need, what you need
Shit, you know how it be, how it be, how it be yeah
All I ever needed was some one and only, this that one and only

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
Okay, scatter brain, scatter brain
On my own island I'm a castaway, who racking up these accolades
You already know so I don't have to say
I'm coming up with words, just like a motherfucking scrabble game
Don't put out my wild fire (Wild) wild fire (Wild)
Take me up a mile higher, a mile higher (Mile)
Talking shit we outside, we outside
I'm making motherfucking classics on my down time
I'm a giant how the fuck you talking down to me
This that shit that make a hater raise up out their seat
And I can't see you from my balcony
I'm in the clouds and you looking like the ground to me
Yeah, told them I'm ready, I tell them again
I'mma keep killing I'm living until I'm a hundred and ten
Yeah, invincible this shit is never gon' end
So tell a friend, to tell a friend
Who tell a friend, who tell a friend

[Hook]
Well, I just need a little space, I can be my own me
Yeah, I'm just giving you a taste
It's some one and only, this that one and only
Yeah, I got what you need, what you need, what you need
Shit, you know how it be, how it be, how it be yeah
All I ever needed was some one and only, this that one and only
