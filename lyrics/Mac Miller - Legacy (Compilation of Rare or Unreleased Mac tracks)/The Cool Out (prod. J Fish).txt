[Intro]
Ah-hah

[Chorus]
Roll a little something up, we can all get high
Hear some people up, let 'em all inside (What)
If you down, then I'm down, we clowning around
Get right for the night, with some drink and some ice (And some ice)
It's just a Sunday night (Night)
There's not much to do now (Ah-hah)
Laying back with the tunes loud (Hey)
Time to cool out (Huh)

[Verse 1]
And, yo, the pants too nice, been crazy
Party after party, dirty dancing, Pat Swayze
Born to be wild, and ain't nothing gonna change me
Dipping form the cops, see me laughing while they chase me
And I'm really usually not the type to do something hot
But I stupidly gotta take too many shots
See, I was wilding out, going bonkers
'Till I started spinning, passed out on the floor in my boxers (Ah-hah)
Waking up in a daze like, "Damn"
What the fuck happened, I don't know where I am
So tonight we just chilling
I feel like shit and my head still killing
I just gotta catch my breath, like CPR
So we put some old tapes in the VCR
Pass around a doobie, enjoy the movie
Sip a beer and eat a lil' of your sushi

[Chorus]
Roll a little something up, we can all get high
Hear some people up, let 'em all inside
If you down, then I'm down, we clowning around
Get right for the night, with some drink and some ice (And some ice)
It's just a Sunday night (Night)
There's not much to do now
Laying back with the tunes loud (Hey)
Time to cool out (Hey)

[Verse 2]
So now it's all about that cool out
Sleeping on the pull out
Chilling with a couple bad hoes in their pool house (Haha)
Ain't no use to get hype tonight
Nah, we gon' get right tonight
With a little bit of Erkel essence
For the should when I cleanse it
A little Guinness and some people that I'm friends with (Uh-huh)
Take a day to recover from the weekend
Sleep in, crack a Swish and put a little weed
It's best not to remain sober
When your life like the movie, "The Hangover"
And you wanna relax, tell the world you'll be back
They expect you to stay connected like a kneecap
But you don't always need that
I'ma get away to a place where the sky seems close enough to taste
24 hours, don't wanna waste one (Nah)
So I'ma wait until the day comes

[Chorus]
Roll a little something up, we can all get high
Hear some people up, let 'em all inside
If you down, then I'm down, we clowning around
Get right for the night, with some drink and some ice
It's just a Sunday night
There's not much to do now
Laying back with the tunes loud
Time to cool out
